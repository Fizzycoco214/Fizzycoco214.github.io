        <p>
            Plated Talks is a tower defense game based around the theme of democracy and how that
            translates to the difficult conversations between family members. 
            I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to work on this game, but I think it's still a cute 5 minute game.

        <p>
            All Chefs On Deck is a co-op puzzle game that takes inspiration from the SNES title <i>Tetris Attack</i>.
            Players must work together to match ingredients in order to complete the recipe in time. The twist of the players'
            boards swapping keeps everyone on their toes. It's one of my favorite games I've made.

        <p>
            MetroHome is a narrative driven rythm game about a child learning to play music and the people he meets along the way.
            Along with this being the first game I composed music for, 
            it was my first rythm game which came with a lot of design challenges.

            Corporate Cupid is a comical buisness sim where you run a matchmaking service. Match clients
            based on their interests while mentored by a supernatural force. Designing how matches are
            evaluated made programming this game a lot of fun and one of my favorites.
